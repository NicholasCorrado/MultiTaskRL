Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /var/lib/condor/execute/slot1/dir_115599/matplotlib-zr0bh1dw because there was an issue with the default path (/.config/matplotlib); it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
